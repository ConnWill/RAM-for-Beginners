# History

The early memory storage devices could only reproduce data in the order it was written, until the first form of RAM called the [Williams Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Williams-tube.jpg) in 1947. The Williams Tube was much smaller and faster making it more efficient than its previous counterpart. 

From 1947-1970 Magnetic-core memory was introduced, which relied on magnetized rings that allowed access to any memory location in any sequence. This was the more prevalent form until the metal-oxide-silicone semiconductor of the 70s came about.

The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor or MOSFET opened the door for many new forms of RAM. MOS Semiconductor was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory, and it overtook magnetic core as the dominant memory technology in the 1970s.
