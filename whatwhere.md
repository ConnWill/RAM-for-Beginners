# What is RAM?

Random-Access Memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that is read and changed in any order. Why itâ€™s so important is because it allows any piece of data to be read or written in the same time regardless of the location of said data, making it much faster than the **Direct Access** storages like a **hard disk** or **compact disk (CD)**. 

RAM is whats called **Volatile Storage**, and unlike its direct access counterparts bolded above it requires power, meaning if power is lost or off the data will be lost. That being said, RAM is not used for long-term memory like a hard drive or any direct access storages. 

RAM is involved with most of your computers functionality such as
* Loading apps
* Browsing the Internet
* Playing your favorite game

If your computer is running slow, checking the RAM usage of certain apps and programs may point you in the right direction. The more programs, games etc. that are running on your computer at once, the more your ram fills up slowing your computer down. Opening the **Task Manager** will allow you to see the RAM usage of running programs.

##Opening Task Manager
* Mac   Spotlight search-> Activity Monitor -> Memory
* Windows   CTRL + Shift + Esc
