# Other Uses For RAM

## Virtual Memory

If a computer has 5 GB of RAM and a  2 GB page file, the total memory for the operating system has 7 GB of total memory. When the system begins to run low on memory it “swaps” portions of RAM to make room for new data.

## RAM Disk

Software can divide portions of a computers RAM, which allows it to act as a faster hard drive called a RAM disk. It is still volatile however, so when power is lost memory is lost.
